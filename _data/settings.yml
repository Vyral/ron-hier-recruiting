  about_markdown: |
    I was born and raised right here in the Antelope Valley. My mom and grandfather were as well. My great grandfather (and his brother) homesteaded out here in the 1880s. So as you can see, I have some deep roots in the AV.

    I started in the real estate business in 1995  as a sales associate at Coldwell Banker. I became a top producer, and in 2003, I joined Keller Williams Realty and became a top producer there. In 2013, I got my brokers license and ventured out on my own, taking with me everything I learned from my previous brokerages (and all the coaching I had along the way).

    I worked from my home office until early 2018. Thatâ€™s when I moved to my current location. Along the way I hired (and coached) my son-in-law Josh Vigil and now he is a top producer, too. I also met Jackie Mendoza, a very talented woman who is now our office manager.

    Currently, I am on the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, the Antelope Valley Community Concerts Board of Directors, a past Grand Knight (and a current member) of the Knights of Columbus, a member and president of the AVBNA networking group, and a member of the Antelope Valley Advisory Group.
